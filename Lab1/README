Lab 1A

I had hard time finding the bug that would not let the program
run the file with execvp function. After hours of examining it
with gdb and test cases, I figured out that my count on the
array of arguments of the command was wrong. Also, I forgot to
put the NULL at the end. The hardest part was the command option
but it was worth trying.

It was also hard to get used to macros in Makefile because
I have always typed all by hands. I feel good about what I have
done and the program runs fairly well.

Lab 1B

Implementing the file flags were easy but I had hard time
how to handle signal. I mainly used man page.

Lab 1C

I had hard time managing to execute the shell script in dash.
I could not find a way to do it so I got stuck at testing cases.
It seemed that the --profile is working as intended.
The attached at the bottom is the part of the test cases I did.


simpsh.c: main source file

Makefile:
	make: builds the executable
	make clean: remove the executable
	make check: does a quick test
	make dist: creates a tarball distribution

test.sh: 8 test cases
